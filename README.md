## Social-Network Backend using MongoDB

This Project is using the MongoDB platform to generate a backend
for a social-network application. In this application we can set-up users
and they can interact with reactions and thoughts. This application shows the power of
MongoDB, which is a Non-SQL database and can handle large "unstructured" data.
